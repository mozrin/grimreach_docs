# Grimreach: An AI‑Fueled MMO Experiment

Welcome to **Grimreach**, a constellation of repos where an AI agent and I are attempting something delightfully reckless: **co‑authoring a full 2D MMO, one deterministic phase at a time**.

This project spans the following repositories:

- **grimreach-core** – the beating heart of the framework  
- **grimreach-client** – the 2D front end where the world comes alive  
- **grimreach-backend** – the server brain keeping everything synchronized  
- **grimreach-protocol** – the shared contract that keeps humans and agents honest  
- **grimreach-assets** – art, maps, and whatever else the AI dreams up  
- **grimreach-docs** – the evolving blueprint of our madness  

Together, the AI and I are drafting a **multi‑phase, ever‑expanding build plan**. Each phase is generated, refined, and implemented as fast as my tokens regenerate. No promises, no guarantees—just pure experimental momentum.

**Will it work? Will it collapse? Will the AI accidentally invent a new genre?**  
There’s only one way to find out.

Pull up a chair.  
Watch the commits.  
Let’s see what this thing becomes.
