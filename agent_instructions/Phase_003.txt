TITLE: Grimreach Workspace – Phase 003: Minimal Integration of grimreach_api

INTENT
Update grimreach_client, grimreach_server, and grimreach_census so they all import
and minimally use the grimreach_api package.  
All projects must compile and run without performing any meaningful actions.

No logic.  
No networking.  
No behavior.  
Only the minimal usage required to confirm that grimreach_api is linked correctly.

TARGET PROJECTS
- grimreach_client (Flutter)
- grimreach_server (Dart)
- grimreach_census (Dart)
- grimreach_api (already completed in Phase 002)

============================================================
SECTION 1 — Update Dependencies
============================================================

1. In each project (client, server, census), update pubspec.yaml to include a
   dependency on grimreach_api using a local path reference.

2. Ensure the dependency block points to:
   ../grimreach_api

3. Do not add any other dependencies in this phase.

============================================================
SECTION 2 — grimreach_client Minimal Integration
============================================================

1. Update the client entrypoint so that it:
   - imports grimreach_api
   - instantiates at least one class from grimreach_api (e.g., Player)
   - prints a simple confirmation message
   - launches a minimal Flutter root widget (no UI required)

2. Remove or empty the following files, since grimreach_api now provides these models:
   - grimreach_client/lib/core/models/player.dart
   - grimreach_client/lib/core/models/entity.dart
   - grimreach_client/lib/core/models/world_state.dart

3. Do not remove the directories containing these files.

4. No other client files should be modified in this phase.

============================================================
SECTION 3 — grimreach_server Minimal Integration
============================================================

1. Update the server entrypoint so that it:
   - imports grimreach_api
   - instantiates at least one shared model (e.g., WorldState)
   - prints a simple confirmation message
   - performs no networking or logic

2. Remove or empty the following files:
   - grimreach_server/lib/core/player.dart
   - grimreach_server/lib/core/entity.dart
   - grimreach_server/lib/core/world_state.dart

3. Do not remove the directories containing these files.

4. No other server files should be modified in this phase.

============================================================
SECTION 4 — grimreach_census Minimal Integration
============================================================

1. Update the census entrypoint so that it:
   - imports grimreach_api
   - instantiates at least one shared model (e.g., WorldState)
   - prints a simple confirmation message

2. Update the census_models file so that it:
   - imports grimreach_api
   - defines a simple wrapper class referencing WorldState

3. No other census files should be modified in this phase.

============================================================
SECTION 5 — Cleanup of Redundant Files
============================================================

1. Delete or empty all redundant model files that duplicate grimreach_api types:
   - client: player.dart, entity.dart, world_state.dart
   - server: player.dart, entity.dart, world_state.dart

2. Do not remove any directories.

3. Do not modify any other files.

============================================================
COMPLETION CRITERIA
============================================================

- All three projects compile with no errors.
- All three projects successfully import grimreach_api.
- All redundant model files are removed or emptied.
- No project performs any logic or networking.
- Running each project prints a minimal confirmation message and exits cleanly.
