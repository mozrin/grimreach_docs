TITLE: Grimreach Workspace – Phase 006: Minimal FlameGame Bootstrapped Client

INTENT
Upgrade grimreach_client so that it uses FlameGame as the root of the application.
The client must:
- compile on all supported platforms
- initialize Flame correctly
- run a minimal FlameGame loop
- render nothing
- continue connecting to the server and receiving world updates

No gameplay logic.  
No assets.  
No scenes beyond a stub.  
Only a minimal Flame bootstrap.

============================================================
SECTION 1 — Update grimreach_client main.dart
============================================================

1. Replace the existing main.dart file with a version that:
   - establishes a WebSocket connection to the server
   - sends a handshake message using grimreach_api
   - listens for WorldState messages and prints summary information
   - initializes a FlameGame instance
   - uses GameWidget as the root widget instead of Directionality/SizedBox

2. Ensure the file imports:
   - Flutter widgets
   - Flame’s GameWidget
   - grimreach_api
   - the GameLoop class created in this phase

3. Ensure the file contains no rendering logic and no Flame components beyond GameLoop.

============================================================
SECTION 2 — Create minimal Flame GameLoop
============================================================

1. Update the file grimreach_client/lib/game/engine/game_loop.dart so that:
   - it defines a FlameGame subclass named GameLoop
   - it loads a single scene component during onLoad
   - it contains no rendering logic
   - it contains no update logic beyond the default Flame behavior

2. Ensure the GameLoop class references a WorldScene component (created in Section 3).

============================================================
SECTION 3 — Create minimal WorldScene
============================================================

1. Create a new file named world_scene.dart inside:
   grimreach_client/lib/game/engine/

2. Define a minimal Flame Component class named WorldScene that:
   - implements an empty render method (draws nothing)
   - implements an empty update method (does nothing)
   - contains no children, no assets, and no logic

3. This component serves only as a placeholder scene.

============================================================
SECTION 4 — Remove unused Directionality root
============================================================

1. Remove the Directionality/SizedBox root widget previously used in Phase 003.
2. Ensure the Flame GameWidget is now the sole root widget.
3. No other UI files require modification.

============================================================
SECTION 5 — No changes to server or census
============================================================

1. grimreach_server remains exactly as implemented in Phase 005.
2. grimreach_census remains exactly as implemented in Phase 005.
3. No new behavior is added to either project in this phase.

============================================================
COMPLETION CRITERIA
============================================================

- grimreach_client compiles successfully on all supported platforms.
- grimreach_client launches a FlameGame instance with no rendering.
- grimreach_client continues to connect to the server and print world updates.
- grimreach_server continues broadcasting empty WorldState messages.
- grimreach_census continues receiving and printing world updates.
- No gameplay logic exists.
- No assets are required.
- The entire workspace runs cleanly with a Flame-powered client.
