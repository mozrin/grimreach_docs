TITLE: Grimreach Workspace – Phase 007: Introduce Shared Zone Model + Zone Propagation

INTENT
Define and integrate a shared Zone model across the entire Grimreach workspace.
This phase introduces the first meaningful world data flowing through the system.

This phase must:
- Add a Zone enum to grimreach_api
- Add a zone field to the shared Player model
- Update WorldState to include zone information (no structural changes required)
- Update grimreach_server to assign a zone to each connected client
- Update grimreach_server to include zone information in every WorldState broadcast
- Update grimreach_client to detect and print zone changes
- Update grimreach_census to log zone distribution
- Ensure all projects compile and run with no errors

No gameplay logic.  
No movement.  
No combat.  
No systems.  
Only zone assignment and propagation.

============================================================
SECTION 1 — grimreach_api: Add Shared Zone Model
============================================================

1. Create a new file named `zone.dart` inside grimreach_api/lib.
2. Define a Zone enum with at least two values:
   - safe
   - wilderness
3. Update the shared Player model to include:
   - a new field named `zone`
   - default value set to `safe`
4. Update Player serialization/deserialization to include the zone value.
5. No other grimreach_api files require modification.

============================================================
SECTION 2 — grimreach_server: Assign Zones to Players
============================================================

1. When a new WebSocket connection is accepted:
   - Create a new Player instance for that connection.
   - Assign the Player a zone value.
   - The assignment method must be deterministic and simple (e.g., alternating safe/wilderness).
2. Store the Player instance in a server-side collection keyed by WebSocket.
3. Ensure the tick loop includes all Player instances in the WorldState broadcast.
4. Ensure the zone value is included in the serialized WorldState.

============================================================
SECTION 3 — grimreach_client: Detect and Print Zone Changes
============================================================

1. When receiving a WorldState message:
   - Identify the Player instance representing the local client.
   - Compare the Player’s current zone to the previously known zone.
   - If the zone has changed, print a message indicating the new zone.
2. No rendering changes are required.
3. No Flame components need modification.

============================================================
SECTION 4 — grimreach_census: Log Zone Distribution
============================================================

1. When receiving a WorldState message:
   - Count how many players are in the safe zone.
   - Count how many players are in the wilderness zone.
   - Print the counts.
2. No storage or analytics logic is required in this phase.

============================================================
SECTION 5 — No Other Files Modified
============================================================

- Do not modify any Flame components.
- Do not modify any UI files.
- Do not modify any server systems.
- Do not introduce gameplay logic.

============================================================
