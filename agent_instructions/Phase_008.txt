TITLE: Grimreach Workspace – Phase 008: Introduce Shared Entities + Server Entity Population

INTENT
Extend the Grimreach world model to include basic entities.
This phase introduces:
- a minimal shared Entity model (already present in grimreach_api)
- server-side creation of placeholder entities
- inclusion of entities in every WorldState broadcast
- client acknowledgement of entity presence
- census tracking of entity counts

No gameplay logic.  
No movement.  
No rendering.  
Only entity presence and propagation.

============================================================
SECTION 1 — grimreach_api (No Changes Required)
============================================================

1. Confirm that grimreach_api already contains:
   - Entity model
   - Player model
   - WorldState model
   - Message and MessageCodec

2. No modifications to grimreach_api are required in this phase.

============================================================
SECTION 2 — grimreach_server: Populate Entities
============================================================

1. Update the server’s world tick logic so that:
   - a fixed set of placeholder entities is created or maintained
   - these entities are included in the WorldState sent to clients

2. Entity requirements:
   - each entity must have a unique id
   - no position, behavior, or logic is required
   - entities may be static and identical across ticks

3. Ensure the server includes the entity list in every WorldState broadcast.

4. Ensure the server logs entity count during development (optional).

============================================================
SECTION 3 — grimreach_client: Acknowledge Entities
============================================================

1. When receiving a WorldState message:
   - extract the list of entities
   - print the number of entities received
   - do not render entities
   - do not store or track entities beyond printing

2. No Flame components should be modified in this phase.

============================================================
SECTION 4 — grimreach_census: Track Entity Counts
============================================================

1. When receiving a WorldState message:
   - extract the list of entities
   - print the total number of entities
   - no storage, indexing, or analytics logic is required

2. No additional census models or files should be created.

============================================================
SECTION 5 — No Other Files Modified
============================================================

- Do not modify any Flame components.
- Do not modify any UI files.
- Do not modify any server systems beyond adding static entities.
- Do not introduce gameplay logic.

============================================================
COMPLETION CRITERIA
============================================================

- grimreach_server includes a list of placeholder entities in every WorldState.
- grimreach_client prints the number of entities received.
- grimreach_census prints the number of entities received.
- All projects compile and run with no errors.
- No gameplay logic exists.
- No rendering or movement is introduced.
- The entire workspace runs cleanly with entity propagation.
