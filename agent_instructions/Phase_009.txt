TITLE: Grimreach Workspace – Phase 009: Zone-Based Entity Assignment + Propagation

INTENT
Extend the entity system by assigning each entity to a zone.
This phase introduces:
- zone-tagged entities
- server-side assignment of entity zones
- inclusion of entity zone information in every WorldState broadcast
- client acknowledgement of entity zone distribution
- census tracking of entity zone distribution

No movement.  
No AI.  
No rendering.  
Only zone-tagged entity presence and propagation.

============================================================
SECTION 1 — grimreach_api: Confirm Zone Compatibility
============================================================

1. Confirm that grimreach_api already contains:
   - Zone enum
   - Entity model
   - Player model
   - WorldState model

2. No structural changes are required in grimreach_api for this phase.

3. If the Entity model does not yet contain a zone field:
   - add a zone field
   - ensure it serializes and deserializes correctly
   - default zone should be `Zone.safe`

============================================================
SECTION 2 — grimreach_server: Assign Zones to Entities
============================================================

1. Update the server’s entity creation logic so that:
   - each entity is assigned a zone
   - zone assignment is deterministic and simple (e.g., alternating safe/wilderness)

2. Ensure that:
   - entities retain their assigned zone across ticks
   - entities are included in every WorldState broadcast
   - entity zone information is serialized and transmitted

3. No movement or behavior should be added to entities.

============================================================
SECTION 3 — grimreach_client: Acknowledge Entity Zones
============================================================

1. When receiving a WorldState message:
   - extract the list of entities
   - count how many entities belong to each zone
   - print the counts (e.g., safe vs wilderness)

2. Do not render entities.
3. Do not store entities beyond printing summary information.

============================================================
SECTION 4 — grimreach_census: Track Entity Zone Distribution
============================================================

1. When receiving a WorldState message:
   - extract the list of entities
   - count how many entities belong to each zone
   - print the distribution

2. No storage, indexing, or analytics logic is required.

============================================================
SECTION 5 — No Other Files Modified
============================================================

- Do not modify Flame components.
- Do not modify UI files.
- Do not introduce gameplay logic.
- Do not introduce movement or AI.

============================================================
COMPLETION CRITERIA
============================================================

- grimreach_server assigns a zone to each entity.
- grimreach_server includes entity zone information in every WorldState broadcast.
- grimreach_client prints entity zone distribution on each update.
- grimreach_census prints entity zone distribution on each update.
- All projects compile and run with no errors.
- No gameplay logic exists.
- No rendering or movement is introduced.
- The entire workspace runs cleanly with zone-tagged entity propagation.
