TITLE: Grimreach Workspace – Phase 010: Introduce Entity Types + Typed Entity Propagation

INTENT
Extend the entity system by introducing entity types.
This phase adds:
- a shared EntityType enum in grimreach_api
- a type field on each Entity
- server-side assignment of entity types
- inclusion of entity type information in every WorldState broadcast
- client acknowledgement of entity type distribution
- census tracking of entity type distribution

No movement.  
No AI.  
No rendering.  
Only typed entity presence and propagation.

============================================================
SECTION 1 — grimreach_api: Add Shared EntityType
============================================================

1. Create a new file named `entity_type.dart` inside grimreach_api/lib.
2. Define an EntityType enum with at least three values, such as:
   - npc
   - resource
   - structure
3. Update the Entity model so that:
   - it includes a new field named `type`
   - the field defaults to a valid EntityType value
   - serialization and deserialization include the type field
4. No other grimreach_api files require modification.

============================================================
SECTION 2 — grimreach_server: Assign Types to Entities
============================================================

1. Update the server’s entity creation logic so that:
   - each entity is assigned an EntityType
   - assignment is deterministic and simple (e.g., round-robin across types)
2. Ensure that:
   - entities retain their assigned type across ticks
   - entity type information is included in every WorldState broadcast
3. Do not introduce:
   - movement
   - AI
   - behavior
   - spawning logic beyond static placeholder entities

============================================================
SECTION 3 — grimreach_client: Acknowledge Entity Types
============================================================

1. When receiving a WorldState message:
   - extract the list of entities
   - count how many entities belong to each EntityType
   - print the distribution
2. Do not render entities.
3. Do not store entities beyond printing summary information.

============================================================
SECTION 4 — grimreach_census: Track Entity Type Distribution
============================================================

1. When receiving a WorldState message:
   - extract the list of entities
   - count how many entities belong to each EntityType
   - print the distribution
2. No storage, indexing, or analytics logic is required.

============================================================
SECTION 5 — No Other Files Modified
============================================================

- Do not modify Flame components.
- Do not modify UI files.
- Do not introduce gameplay logic.
- Do not introduce movement or AI.
- Do not introduce rendering.

============================================================
COMPLETION CRITERIA
============================================================

- grimreach_api contains a shared EntityType enum.
- Entity includes a type field with serialization support.
- grimreach_server assigns a type to each entity.
- grimreach_server includes entity type information in every WorldState broadcast.
- grimreach_client prints entity type distribution on each update.
- grimreach_census prints entity type distribution on each update.
- All projects compile and run with no errors.
- No gameplay logic exists.
- No rendering or movement is introduced.
- The entire workspace runs cleanly with typed entity propagation.
