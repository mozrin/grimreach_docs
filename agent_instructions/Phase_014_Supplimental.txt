TITLE: Grimreach Workspace – Phase 014 Supplemental: Introduce Assets Repository

INTENT
Add a new top‑level project to the Grimreach workspace named `assets`. This project
stores non-code, non-runtime, non-generated visual and branding assets for the entire
workspace. It begins minimal, with a single file (`grimreach_logo.png`) placed at the
root. This phase defines the initial structure and long-term purpose of the repository
without committing to any specific asset pipeline.

This phase adds:
- a new workspace project: assets
- initial folder structure
- initial asset placement
- documentation updates to reflect the new project

No build logic.
No asset pipeline.
No rendering integration.
No tooling requirements.

============================================================
SECTION 1 — Create the Assets Project
============================================================

Create a new top-level repository or folder named:

    assets/

This project is dedicated exclusively to static, non-executable files used across the
workspace. It must not contain:
- code
- scripts
- build systems
- generated files
- runtime logic

============================================================
SECTION 2 — Initial File Placement
============================================================

Place the following file in the root of the assets project:

    assets/grimreach_logo.png

This file represents the initial branding mark for the Grimreach workspace.

============================================================
SECTION 3 — Initial Folder Structure
============================================================

Define the following structure to guide future organization:

    assets/
      branding/        (logos, marks, icons)
      ui/              (future UI elements)
      world/           (future world-space visual assets)
      temp/            (scratch space for agents; not versioned long-term)
      README.md        (project description)

Place `grimreach_logo.png` in:

    assets/branding/grimreach_logo.png

The root may remain empty except for the README.

============================================================
SECTION 4 — Long-Term Purpose (Non-Binding)
============================================================

The assets project may eventually support:
- workspace-wide branding
- UI elements for grimreach_client
- world-space glyphs or symbols
- documentation illustrations
- promotional or meta assets
- future automated pipelines (if introduced in later phases)

This phase does NOT require:
- asset optimization
- asset versioning rules
- asset pipelines
- integration with client or server

============================================================
SECTION 5 — grimreach_client Responsibilities
============================================================

None in this phase.

The client must not:
- load assets
- reference assets
- assume any asset pipeline exists

============================================================
SECTION 6 — grimreach_server Responsibilities
============================================================

None in this phase.

The server must not:
- load assets
- reference assets
- assume any asset pipeline exists

============================================================
SECTION 7 — grimreach_census Responsibilities
============================================================

None in this phase.

============================================================
SECTION 8 — Documentation Update Requirements
============================================================

Update `grimreach_docs/README.md` to include the new project in the workspace layout.

Add a new entry under the workspace structure section:

    - assets/ — static branding and visual assets for the workspace

No other README sections should be modified.

============================================================
SECTION 9 — No Other Files Modified
============================================================

This phase introduces no code changes and no runtime behavior.

============================================================
COMPLETION CRITERIA
============================================================

- assets project exists at the workspace root.
- grimreach_logo.png is placed in assets/branding/.
- README updated with the new project entry.
- No code or runtime systems reference the assets project.
- Workspace structure remains stable and consistent.
