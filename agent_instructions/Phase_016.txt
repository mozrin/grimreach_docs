TITLE: Grimreach Workspace – Phase 016: Deterministic Player–Entity Proximity Detection

INTENT
Introduce deterministic proximity detection between players and entities.
This phase adds:
- server-side proximity evaluation
- distance thresholds
- zone-aware proximity summaries
- client acknowledgement of proximity events
- census tracking of proximity patterns

No AI.  
No combat.  
No interactions.  
No rendering.  
Only deterministic proximity detection and propagation.

============================================================
SECTION 1 — Define Proximity Rules
============================================================

1. Introduce a minimal proximity rule structure that defines:
   - a fixed proximity radius (e.g., distance threshold)
   - deterministic distance evaluation (no randomness)
   - no physics or collision logic

2. Proximity rules must:
   - apply equally to all players and entities
   - be simple and predictable
   - evaluate every tick

3. Distance must be computed using:
   - a simple metric (e.g., Euclidean or Manhattan)
   - no optimization or spatial partitioning

============================================================
SECTION 2 — Implement Server Proximity Evaluation
============================================================

1. Integrate proximity evaluation into the server tick loop.
2. On each tick:
   - compute distance between each player and each entity
   - determine whether the distance is within the proximity radius
   - record proximity results for the current tick

3. Proximity evaluation must:
   - be deterministic
   - not modify player or entity behavior
   - not trigger any gameplay effects

============================================================
SECTION 3 — Include Proximity Summaries in WorldState
============================================================

1. Extend the WorldState broadcast to include:
   - a minimal proximity summary (e.g., counts or boolean flags)
   - no detailed lists or per-entity breakdowns

2. Proximity summaries must:
   - not introduce new complex structures
   - remain lightweight and easy to serialize

============================================================
SECTION 4 — grimreach_client: Acknowledge Proximity Events
============================================================

1. When receiving a WorldState message:
   - read the proximity summary
   - print simple proximity information (e.g., “Player near 2 entities”)

2. Do not render proximity.
3. Do not store proximity data beyond printing summary information.

============================================================
SECTION 5 — grimreach_census: Track Proximity Patterns
============================================================

1. When receiving a WorldState message:
   - read the proximity summary
   - print aggregated proximity information (e.g., “Total proximities this tick: 7”)
   - optionally print zone-based proximity counts

2. No storage, indexing, or analytics logic is required.

============================================================
SECTION 6 — No Other Files Modified
============================================================

- Do not modify Flame components.
- Do not modify UI files.
- Do not introduce AI, combat, or rendering.
- Do not introduce interactions or physics.

============================================================
COMPLETION CRITERIA
============================================================

- Server defines deterministic proximity rules.
- Server evaluates player–entity proximity every tick.
- WorldState includes minimal proximity summaries.
- grimreach_client prints proximity information.
- grimreach_census prints aggregated proximity patterns.
- All projects compile and run with no errors.
- No gameplay logic exists.
- No rendering or input is introduced.
- The entire workspace runs cleanly with deterministic proximity detection.
