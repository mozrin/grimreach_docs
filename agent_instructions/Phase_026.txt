TITLE: Grimreach Workspace – Phase 026: Deterministic Population Saturation + Pressure-Based Zone Crowding

INTENT
Introduce deterministic population saturation rules that limit or modify spawning based on:
- zone crowding
- faction pressure (Phase 025)
- deterministic population caps

This phase adds:
- zone-level population caps
- pressure-influenced saturation thresholds
- spawn suppression or slowdown under crowding
- world updates reflecting saturation
- client acknowledgement of saturation states
- census tracking of saturation and crowding dynamics

No AI.  
No combat.  
No diplomacy.  
No rendering.  
Only deterministic saturation propagation.

============================================================
SECTION 1 — Define Population Saturation Rules
============================================================

1. Introduce a minimal saturation rule structure that defines:
   - a maximum population per zone
   - a maximum population per faction per zone (optional)
   - deterministic thresholds for “crowded” and “overcrowded” states
   - no randomness

2. Saturation rules must:
   - be static
   - be deterministic
   - not involve combat or diplomacy

3. Saturation states must be:
   - updated every tick
   - based solely on entity counts

============================================================
SECTION 2 — Implement Server Saturation Evaluation
============================================================

1. Integrate saturation evaluation into the server tick loop.
2. On each tick:
   - count total entities per zone
   - compare counts to saturation thresholds
   - assign each zone a saturation state:
     - normal
     - crowded
     - overcrowded

3. Saturation evaluation must:
   - not modify entity or player behavior directly
   - not trigger territory changes
   - not introduce randomness

============================================================
SECTION 3 — Apply Saturation to Spawn Rates
============================================================

1. Modify spawn rules (Phase 011/013/025) so that:
   - normal zones spawn normally
   - crowded zones reduce spawn rates deterministically
   - overcrowded zones suppress spawning entirely

2. Pressure (Phase 025) must:
   - increase or decrease saturation thresholds deterministically
   - never override absolute maximum caps

3. Spawn rate adjustments must:
   - be clamped
   - remain deterministic
   - not introduce new entity types

============================================================
SECTION 4 — Include Saturation Summaries in WorldState
============================================================

1. Extend the WorldState broadcast to include:
   - saturation state per zone
   - optional “spawn suppressed” flags

2. Saturation summaries must:
   - remain lightweight
   - not introduce complex serialization

============================================================
SECTION 5 — grimreach_client: Acknowledge Saturation States
============================================================

1. When receiving a WorldState message:
   - read saturation summaries
   - print simple information (e.g., “Wilderness overcrowded — spawning suppressed”)

2. Do not render saturation.
3. Do not store saturation data beyond printing summary information.

============================================================
SECTION 6 — grimreach_census: Track Crowding Dynamics
============================================================

1. When receiving a WorldState message:
   - read saturation summaries
   - correlate saturation with spawn counts and pressure
   - print aggregated information (e.g., “Safe zone crowded for 4 ticks”)

2. No storage, indexing, or analytics logic is required.

============================================================
SECTION 7 — No Other Files Modified
============================================================

- Do not modify Flame components.
- Do not modify UI files.
- Do not introduce AI, combat, or rendering.
- Do not introduce diplomacy or interactions.

============================================================
COMPLETION CRITERIA
============================================================

- Server defines deterministic saturation rules.
- Saturation states update every tick.
- Spawn rates adjust based on saturation and pressure.
- WorldState includes saturation summaries.
- grimreach_client prints saturation information.
- grimreach_census prints crowding dynamics.
- All projects compile and run with no errors.
- No gameplay logic exists.
- No rendering or input is introduced.
- The entire workspace runs cleanly with saturation-driven spawn behavior.
