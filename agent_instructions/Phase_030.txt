TITLE: Grimreach Workspace – Phase 030: Deterministic World Seasons + Seasonal Global Modifiers

INTENT
Introduce deterministic seasonal cycles that affect the entire world.
This phase adds:
- global seasons
- deterministic season transitions
- season-based global modifiers
- server-side seasonal evaluation
- world updates reflecting seasonal state
- client acknowledgement of seasonal changes
- census tracking of seasonal cycles

No AI.  
No combat.  
No diplomacy.  
No rendering.  
Only deterministic seasonal propagation.

============================================================
SECTION 1 — Define Seasonal Rules
============================================================

1. Introduce a minimal season rule structure that defines:
   - a global season state
   - deterministic transitions between seasons
   - no randomness

2. Seasons may include:
   - spring
   - summer
   - autumn
   - winter

3. Seasonal rules must:
   - be static
   - be deterministic
   - not involve AI or decision-making

============================================================
SECTION 2 — Implement Seasonal Cycles
============================================================

1. Integrate seasonal updates into the server tick loop.
2. On each tick:
   - update the global season deterministically
   - apply simple cycle logic (e.g., spring → summer → autumn → winter → spring)

3. Seasonal cycles must:
   - not modify entity or player behavior directly
   - not introduce randomness
   - not trigger territory changes

============================================================
SECTION 3 — Apply Seasonal Global Modifiers
============================================================

1. Introduce minimal seasonal modifiers that affect:
   - spawn rates (e.g., spring increases spawns)
   - movement speed (e.g., winter slows movement)
   - influence gain (e.g., summer boosts influence)
   - pressure (e.g., autumn reduces pressure)

2. Modifiers must:
   - be deterministic
   - be clamped
   - not override existing systems entirely

3. Seasonal modifiers must:
   - not introduce new entity types
   - not introduce physics or interactions

============================================================
SECTION 4 — Include Seasonal Summaries in WorldState
============================================================

1. Extend the WorldState broadcast to include:
   - current global season
   - optional “seasonal modifier active” flags

2. Seasonal summaries must:
   - remain lightweight
   - not introduce complex serialization

============================================================
SECTION 5 — grimreach_client: Acknowledge Seasonal Changes
============================================================

1. When receiving a WorldState message:
   - read seasonal summaries
   - detect season transitions
   - print simple information (e.g., “Season changed to winter”)

2. Do not render seasons.
3. Do not store seasonal data beyond printing summary information.

============================================================
SECTION 6 — grimreach_census: Track Seasonal Cycles
============================================================

1. When receiving a WorldState message:
   - read seasonal summaries
   - correlate seasons with spawn, movement, influence, pressure, and hazards
   - print aggregated information (e.g., “Winter reducing global movement speed”)

2. No storage, indexing, or analytics logic is required.

============================================================
SECTION 7 — No Other Files Modified
============================================================

- Do not modify Flame components.
- Do not modify UI files.
- Do not introduce AI, combat, or rendering.
- Do not introduce diplomacy or interactions.

============================================================
COMPLETION CRITERIA
============================================================

- Server defines deterministic seasonal rules.
- Seasons update every tick.
- Seasonal modifiers affect global systems deterministically.
- WorldState includes seasonal summaries.
- grimreach_client prints seasonal change information.
- grimreach_census prints seasonal cycle summaries.
- All projects compile and run with no errors.
- No gameplay logic exists.
- No rendering or input is introduced.
- The entire workspace runs cleanly with season-driven systemic behavior.
