TITLE: Grimreach Workspace – Phase 039: Deterministic World Resonance + Multi-Cycle Synchronization Events

INTENT
Introduce deterministic “world resonance,” a global synchronization effect triggered when
multiple long-cycle systems align in specific deterministic patterns.
This phase adds:
- a global resonance state
- deterministic resonance detection rules
- resonance-based global modifiers
- world updates reflecting resonance events
- client acknowledgement of resonance peaks
- census tracking of resonance patterns

No AI.
No combat.
No diplomacy.
No rendering.
Only deterministic synchronization propagation.

============================================================
SECTION 1 — Define World Resonance Rules
============================================================

1. Introduce a minimal resonance structure that defines:
   - a global resonance value or state
   - deterministic conditions for resonance activation
   - deterministic conditions for resonance decay
   - no randomness

2. Resonance may be triggered by:
   - season alignment (Phase 030)
   - lunar alignment (Phase 031)
   - constellation alignment (Phase 032)
   - harmonic alignment (Phase 033)
   - mood stability (Phase 034)
   - memory thresholds (Phase 035)
   - inertia dominance (Phase 036)
   - entropy suppression (Phase 037)
   - equilibrium positivity (Phase 038)

3. Resonance rules must:
   - be static
   - be deterministic
   - not involve AI or decision-making

============================================================
SECTION 2 — Implement Resonance Evaluation
============================================================

1. Integrate resonance updates into the server tick loop.
2. On each tick:
   - read all global cycle states
   - evaluate deterministic resonance conditions
   - update resonance state or value
   - clamp resonance to valid bounds

3. Resonance evaluation must:
   - not modify entity or player behavior directly
   - not introduce randomness
   - not trigger territory changes

============================================================
SECTION 3 — Apply Resonance-Based Modifiers
============================================================

1. Introduce minimal resonance modifiers that:
   - amplify influence gain during resonance peaks
   - reduce global pressure during resonance stability
   - increase environmental intensity during resonance surges
   - accelerate or decelerate migration pressure depending on resonance polarity

2. Modifiers must:
   - be deterministic
   - be clamped
   - not override existing systems entirely

3. Resonance modifiers must:
   - not introduce new entity types
   - not introduce physics or interactions

============================================================
SECTION 4 — Include Resonance Summaries in WorldState
============================================================

1. Extend the WorldState broadcast to include:
   - current resonance value or state
   - optional “resonance peak” or “resonance trough” flags

2. Resonance summaries must:
   - remain lightweight
   - not introduce complex serialization

============================================================
SECTION 5 — grimreach_client: Acknowledge Resonance Peaks
============================================================

1. When receiving a WorldState message:
   - read resonance summaries
   - detect resonance peaks or troughs
   - print simple information (e.g., “World resonance peak detected”)

2. Do not render resonance.
3. Do not store resonance data beyond printing summary information.

============================================================
SECTION 6 — grimreach_census: Track Resonance Patterns
============================================================

1. When receiving a WorldState message:
   - read resonance summaries
   - correlate resonance with all global cycles and modifiers
   - print aggregated information (e.g., “Resonance peak aligning with harmonic amplification”)

2. No storage, indexing, or analytics logic is required.

============================================================
SECTION 7 — No Other Files Modified
============================================================

- Do not modify Flame components.
- Do not modify UI files.
- Do not introduce AI, combat, or rendering.
- Do not introduce diplomacy or interactions.

============================================================
COMPLETION CRITERIA
============================================================

- Server defines deterministic resonance rules.
- Resonance updates every tick.

- WorldState includes resonance summaries.
- grimreach_client prints resonance change information.
- grimreach_census prints resonance pattern summaries.
- All projects compile and run with no errors.
- No gameplay logic exists.
- No rendering or input is introduced.
