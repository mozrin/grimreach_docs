TITLE: Grimreach Workspace – Phase 044: Deterministic World Attractors + Stable/Unstable Systemic Basins

INTENT
Introduce deterministic “world attractors,” stable and unstable systemic basins that the
global state gravitates toward based on long-cycle systems. Attractors do not override
systems; they describe the basin of behavior the world is currently falling into.

This phase adds:
- global attractor identification
- deterministic attractor mapping rules
- attractor-based systemic influence modifiers
- world updates reflecting attractor transitions
- client acknowledgement of attractor shifts
- census tracking of attractor dynamics

No AI.
No combat.
No diplomacy.
No rendering.
Only deterministic basin propagation.

============================================================
SECTION 1 — Define World Attractor Rules
============================================================

1. Introduce a minimal attractor structure that defines:
   - a global attractor state (e.g., stable_basin, chaotic_basin, growth_basin, decay_basin)
   - deterministic mapping rules from phase-space (Phase 043)
   - no randomness

2. Attractors are influenced by:
   - polarity (Phase 042)
   - drift vectors (Phase 041)
   - cadence (Phase 040)
   - resonance (Phase 039)
   - equilibrium (Phase 038)
   - inertia/entropy balance (Phases 036–037)
   - memory (Phase 035)
   - harmonics (Phase 033)
   - seasons/lunar/constellation cycles (Phases 030–032)

3. Attractor rules must:
   - be static
   - be deterministic
   - not involve AI or decision-making

============================================================
SECTION 2 — Implement Attractor Evaluation
============================================================

1. Integrate attractor updates into the server tick loop.
2. On each tick:
   - read phase-space coordinates (Phase 043)
   - determine which attractor basin the world falls into
   - update attractor state deterministically
   - clamp attractor transitions to valid rules

3. Attractor evaluation must:
   - not modify entity or player behavior directly
   - not introduce randomness
   - not trigger territory changes

============================================================
SECTION 3 — Apply Attractor-Based Systemic Influence Modifiers
============================================================

1. Introduce minimal attractor modifiers that:
   - bias influence gain based
