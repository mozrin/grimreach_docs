TITLE: Grimreach Workspace – Phase 056: Deterministic Semantic Regions + World-Space Meaning Fields

INTENT
Introduce semantic meaning to the world-space grid (Phase 054–055). These semantics are
NOT gameplay, NOT terrain, and NOT simulation. They are deterministic classifications
derived from VisualState that give each region of the grid a conceptual identity.

This phase adds:
- semantic region classification
- deterministic region boundaries
- meaning fields derived from systemic state
- region-level overlays in the renderer
- census correlation of semantic regions

No gameplay.
No physics.
No interactions.
No entities.
No animation.

============================================================
SECTION 1 — Define Semantic Region Types
============================================================

Introduce deterministic region types derived from VisualState:

1. Stability Region  
   - derived from equilibrium, inertia, entropy

2. Harmony Region  
   - derived from mood, harmonics, memory

3. Drift Region  
   - derived from drift vectors and polarity

4. Rhythm Region  
   - derived from cadence and resonance

5. Structural Region  
   - derived from phase-space, attractors, metastability, hysteresis,
     bifurcation, convergence, coherence

6. Celestial Region  
   - derived from season, lunar, constellation cycles

Regions must:
- be deterministic
- be derived solely from VisualState
- not represent terrain or gameplay zones

============================================================
SECTION 2 — Region Boundary Rules
============================================================

1. Divide the grid into deterministic regions:
   - quadrants
   - radial slices
   - bands
   - clusters
   - or a combination

2. Region boundaries must:
   - be static
   - be deterministic
   - not depend on time
   - not depend on user input
   - not scroll, zoom, or animate

3. Regions must NOT:
   - represent movement
   - represent simulation
   - represent gameplay areas

============================================================
SECTION 3 — Region-Level Meaning Fields
============================================================

Each region receives a deterministic meaning field:

1. Stability Field  
   - high/medium/low stability

2. Harmony Field  
   - calm/neutral/discordant

3. Drift Field  
   - directional bias (N, NE, E, SE, etc.)

4. Rhythm Field  
   - slow/steady/quick

5. Structural Field  
   - stable/unstable/metastable/bifurcating/converging/coherent

6. Celestial Field  
   - seasonal/lunar/constellation influence

Meaning fields must:
- be deterministic
- be static per frame
- not animate or pulse

============================================================
SECTION 4 — grimreach_client Responsibilities
============================================================

The client must:

1. Compute semantic regions from the grid.
2. Assign meaning fields to each region.
3. Render region-level overlays:
   - subtle shading
   - borders
   - glyphs
   - labels (optional, non-textual)
4. Maintain deterministic placement and appearance.
5. Print debug output:
   - “Region NE: structural=metastable”
   - “Region SW: drift=SE”
   - “Region center: harmony=calm”

The client must NOT:
- animate
- interpolate
- scroll
- zoom
- simulate physics
- allow user input to affect rendering

============================================================
SECTION 5 — grimreach_server Responsibilities
============================================================

The server must:
- continue producing VisualState
- remain unaware of semantic regions
- remain fully headless

The server must NOT:
- send region definitions
- send meaning fields
- send spatial hints

============================================================
SECTION 6 — grimreach_census Responsibilities
============================================================

The census must:
- observe semantic regions
- correlate region meaning with systemic state
- print summaries (e.g., “Harmony region expanding due to mood stabilization”)

The census must NOT:
- render
- simulate
- store long-term analytics

============================================================
SECTION 7 — No Other Files Modified
============================================================

- Do not introduce gameplay.
- Do not introduce entities.
- Do not introduce physics.
- Do not introduce animation.
- Only add deterministic semantic region logic to grimreach_client.

============================================================
COMPLETION CRITERIA
============================================================

- grimreach_client renders semantic regions.
- Regions have deterministic meaning fields.
- Visual output shows structured, meaningful world-space.
- No animation or gameplay exists.
- grimreach_server unchanged.
- grimreach_census prints semantic region summaries.
- Workspace compiles and runs with semantic world-space output.
