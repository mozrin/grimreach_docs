TITLE: Grimreach Workspace – Phase 062: Fog-of-Meaning

INTENT
Introduce a visual layer called “Fog-of-Meaning” that obscures or softens regions of
the world that lack semantic clarity. This is not fog of war, not visibility, and not
gameplay. It is a visual metaphor for ambiguity, undefined meaning, and low semantic
density.

This phase adds:
- fog-of-meaning overlays
- semantic density sampling
- region-level fog rendering
- fog layering rules
- census summaries of semantic clarity
- README update for Phase_062

No animation.
No smoothing.
No gameplay.
No simulation.

============================================================
SECTION 1 — Semantic Density Definition
============================================================

Define semantic density as a measure of how “meaningful” a region is.

Examples of low semantic density:
- regions with undefined type
- regions with unstable identity
- regions with conflicting overlays
- regions with no harmonic or memory imprint

Examples of high semantic density:
- regions with stable identity
- regions with strong harmonic/memory imprint
- regions with clear long-cycle influence

Semantic density is computed per region, not per cell.

============================================================
SECTION 2 — Fog-of-Meaning Visualization
============================================================

Introduce a visual overlay called “Fog-of-Meaning”:

- rendered as soft halos, haze, or translucent veils
- applied to regions with low semantic density
- must remain readable and non-destructive
- must not obscure structural markers

Fog must:
- use discrete opacity buckets (none, light, medium, heavy)
- never animate
- never pulse or fade
- never interpolate across regions

============================================================
SECTION 3 — Sampling Rules
============================================================

1. Each region computes semantic density once per tick.
2. Density is derived from region identity, overlays, and harmonic/memory imprint.
3. No smoothing or averaging across regions.
4. No interpolation between cells.
5. Fog updates only when semantic density changes.

============================================================
SECTION 4 — Rendering Rules
============================================================

Fog-of-Meaning overlays must:
- appear above scalar/vector fields
- appear below volumetric fields
- never obscure structural markers
- adapt to region shape and boundaries

Depth order update:

1. Base Tint  
2. Scalar Fields  
3. Vector Fields  
4. Region Flow Visualization  
5. Fog-of-Meaning (new)  
6. Volumetric Fields  
7. Structural Markers

============================================================
SECTION 5 — grimreach_client Responsibilities
============================================================

The client must:

1. Compute semantic density per region.
2. Render fog overlays based on density.
3. Respect depth ordering.
4. Ensure fog does not obscure essential markers.
5. Print debug output:
   - “Region (x,y): semantic density = 0.42”
   - “Fog applied: medium”
   - “Fog-of-Meaning updated for 8 regions”

The client must NOT:
- animate fog
- interpolate fog
- simulate fog
- introduce smoothing

============================================================
SECTION 6 — grimreach_server Responsibilities
============================================================

The server must:
- remain unaware of fog
- continue producing region identity and overlays
- not compute or send fog data

============================================================
SECTION 7 — grimreach_census Responsibilities
============================================================

The census must:
- observe semantic density patterns
- correlate fog with world dynamics
- print summaries (e.g., “High ambiguity in SW quadrant”)

The census must NOT:
- render fog
- simulate fog
- store long-term analytics

============================================================
SECTION 8 — Documentation Update Requirements
============================================================

The agent must update:

**grimreach_docs/README.md**

Specifically:
1. Replace the placeholder entry for Phase_062 with:  
   `| 062 | Fog-of-Meaning |`
2. Ensure the Phase Map reflects this finalized title.
3. Ensure Phase_062 is no longer marked as “future” or “TBD.”

No other README entries should be modified.

============================================================
SECTION 9 — No Other Files Modified
============================================================

- No gameplay systems added.
- No physics systems added.
- No animation systems added.
- Only add fog-of-meaning logic to grimreach_client.
- Only update README as described above.

============================================================
COMPLETION CRITERIA
============================================================

- Fog-of-Meaning overlays render correctly.
- Fog respects depth ordering.
- README updated with correct Phase_062 entry.
- No animation or smoothing exists.
- Server remains unchanged.
- Census prints semantic density summaries.
- Workspace compiles and runs with fog-of-meaning overlays.
