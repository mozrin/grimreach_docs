TITLE: Grimreach Workspace – Phase 011: Deterministic Entity Spawning Rules

INTENT
Introduce deterministic, rule-based entity spawning on the server.
This phase adds:
- a minimal spawn rule system
- zone-aware spawn tables
- server-side periodic spawning
- inclusion of spawned entities in WorldState
- client acknowledgement of spawn counts
- census tracking of spawn density

No movement.  
No AI.  
No combat.  
No rendering.  
Only deterministic spawning and propagation.

============================================================
SECTION 1 — Define Server-Side Spawn Rules
============================================================

1. Create a minimal spawn rule structure on the server that:
   - defines which EntityTypes may spawn in each Zone
   - defines a maximum number of entities per zone
   - defines a spawn interval (e.g., every N ticks)

2. Spawn rules must be:
   - deterministic
   - static
   - simple (e.g., fixed lists or round-robin)

3. No randomness is allowed in this phase.

============================================================
SECTION 2 — Implement Server Spawn Cycle
============================================================

1. Integrate a spawn cycle into the server tick loop.
2. On each spawn interval:
   - evaluate spawn rules
   - determine which zones need additional entities
   - create new entities as needed
   - assign each new entity:
     - a unique id
     - a zone
     - a type (from Phase 010)
3. Ensure spawned entities persist across ticks.
4. Ensure entities do not exceed the per-zone maximum.

============================================================
SECTION 3 — Include Spawned Entities in WorldState
============================================================

1. Ensure all spawned entities are included in the WorldState broadcast.
2. Ensure entity zone and type information is preserved.
3. Ensure entity lists grow only according to spawn rules.

============================================================
SECTION 4 — grimreach_client: Acknowledge Spawn Activity
============================================================

1. When receiving a WorldState message:
   - count total entities
   - count entities per zone
   - count entities per type
   - print summary information

2. Do not render entities.
3. Do not store entities beyond printing summary information.

============================================================
SECTION 5 — grimreach_census: Track Spawn Density
============================================================

1. When receiving a WorldState message:
   - count entities per zone
   - count entities per type
   - print the distribution

2. No storage, indexing, or analytics logic is required.

============================================================
SECTION 6 — No Other Files Modified
============================================================

- Do not modify Flame components.
- Do not modify UI files.
- Do not introduce movement, AI, or combat.
- Do not introduce rendering.

============================================================
COMPLETION CRITERIA
============================================================

- Server defines deterministic spawn rules.
- Server spawns entities according to those rules.
- Spawned entities persist across ticks.
- grimreach_client prints spawn-related summary information.
- grimreach_census prints spawn density information.
- All projects compile and run with no errors.
- No gameplay logic exists.
- No rendering or movement is introduced.
- The entire workspace runs cleanly with deterministic spawning.
